# Dependencies for front-end

- Axios (for connecting front with back)
- react-router-dom (for pages)

# Use

1. Start your client with the following command:

    `npm start`

2. Log into your account (or register), you cannot access /main unless you are logged in.

3. The /main page, has multiple options, including:

    - Selecting a restaurant, and making a reservation for it
    - Viewing your reservations from the eader
    - Logging out

... The options are intuitively created, so you will have an idea of how to use them.
